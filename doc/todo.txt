. settle on naming conventions, rewrite all text labels in templates

. settle on set of sync icons: needs to sync, is syncing, no need to sync

. settle on list of cols available in feed view and in dashboard block; test that it works ok for items relating to deleted nodes

. reset all calls to ez18n to use a single namespace: contentstating/etc...

. produce .dba file

. tpl for sync action results

. fix: it seems the target (almost persistent) object has problems in feeds tpl

. disable access to contenstaging/sync via simple GET, as it's not idempotent?

. in fetches for dashboard, wt, feed list, filter out items in syncing status (or show a different icon)

. for ezp 4.6, add a new subtab in object view for admin design

. cleanup script that resets and initializes feeds

. dependency tracking:
  - all events should not have a pending create event for any of their parents
  - obj relations?

. always store a lot of object data in events, in case obj is deleted later and we want to show meaningful data in contorl panels?

. tpl operator for sync type icon (or text) by its code

. rework dashboard block so that it lists ndoes instead of sync events?
  note that we will have problems with deleted objects not being shown there

. add extended attr. filter: given target feed id, get for every node the sync events pending by using aggregate sql function bit_and

Phase 2:

. in feed view, add an action to init a feed (eg set all objects to "to be synnced" status) or reset it
. allow sync items that fail 3 consecutive sync attempts to be set to "suspended" state
. allow finer grained permissions
. cronjob that passes and removes sync items that have been in sync status for too long
. allow user with 'manage' rights to manually remove sync items from feeds, one by one, if they want to (but trace it)
. merging of replication events
