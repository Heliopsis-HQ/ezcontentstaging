. verify sync between ezpo classes definitions and actual .sql file

. produce .dba file

. reset all calls to ez18n to use a single namespace: contentstating/etc...

. fix usage of can_sync: php code has != idea from tpl msg

. tpl for sync action results

. fix: it seems the target (almost persistent) object has problems in feeds tpl

. disable access to contenstaging/sync via simple GET, as it's not idempotent?

. in fetches for dashboard, wt, feed list, filter out items in syncing status

. for ezp 4.6, add a new subtab in object view for admin design

. cleanup script that removes orphaned item_events


Phase 2:

. in feed view, add an action to init a feed (eg set all objects to "to be synnced" status) or reset it
. allow sync items that fail 3 consecutive sync attempts to be set to "suspended" state
. allow finer grained permissions
. cronjob that passes and removes sync items that have been in sync status for too long
. allow user with 'manage' rights to manually remove sync items from feeds, one by one, if they want to (but trace it)
. merging of replication events
